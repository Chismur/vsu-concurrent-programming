Find max element of the given matrix (of arbitrary size)
which is divisible by 3 (by whole)

_Important:_
1. Sharing the elements between threads have to be element-wise (not row-wise in general)
2. The less elements the given matrix has the less threads have to be created
3. The number of threads are bounded by the number of physical PC's threads
